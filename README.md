### Hiiii ‚ù§Ô∏è„Éæ(Ôºæ‚àáÔºæ) | [My Website](https://kathy.aishiteru.moe) | [Other stuff I do](https://kathy.aishiteru.moe/wowks)

I'm taking on Computer Science because I love technical and theory things. I also want to improve user experience by finding actual solutions, all while not sacrificing one for another.

#### The Chrome OS TechXP (technical experience)
I no longer have access to my Chromebook so these are the only things I could find.
- [Crostini's Debian Buster is missing dependencies for Syncplay.](https://github.com/Syncplay/syncplay/issues/393)
- [Crouton being broken and downright unusable.](https://github.com/dnschneid/crouton/issues/4345)
- [The CrOS community brings pitchforks to my own complaints and personal opinion.](https://www.reddit.com/r/chromeos/comments/k4iihd/)

#### Improving your Windows 10 experience
- [PowerToys is nice and very helpful for you powerusers.](https://github.com/microsoft/PowerToys/)
- [In fact, please look at Microsoft Open Source often, they have really cool stuff.](https://opensource.microsoft.com/projects)
- [Use either of those apps if you use Google Drive normally. I recommend `Google Drive for Desktop`.](https://support.google.com/drive/answer/7638428)
- [In case you never knew about lively wallpapers and used to love screensavers.](https://store.steampowered.com/app/431960/Wallpaper_Engine/)
- [WSL2 and VSCode together](https://code.visualstudio.com/blogs/2019/09/03/wsl2)

#### PSVita
I kid you not, those are really good when you hack one of these with a CFW. I am not responsible for whatever happens to your device though.

#### In the future, I will start to fill up this section with even more niche (I think) and cool stuff I've come across. Probably.
