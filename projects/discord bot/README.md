#### This bot is an experiment, and is not meant to be ran individually.
You can use anything from my projects as you wish. I will not be responsible if something breaks though.

If you want to run this bot, please do the following by order:
1. Create a file named `allysaqt.json`. Inside the file, place the following:   
`{"Testing Server ID here": {"settings": {"prefix": "Prefix here"}}}`   
2. Replace the token entry lines inside main.py to how you want it to be handled (based on your application).
*If you're new, remove the last 2nd & 3rd line and replace the arguments inside bot.run with the string of your bot token.*
3. Optional: Inside on_ready function, the 2nd line channel ID should be replaced to a testing server ID.
