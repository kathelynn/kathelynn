#### This bot is an experiment, and is not meant to be ran individually.
You can use anything from my projects as you wish. Please help me fix bugs and optimize code, any feedback is appreciated!

If you still want to run this bot locally, please do the following by order:
1. Create a file named `allysaqt.json`. Inside the file, place the following:   
`{"Testing Server ID here": {"settings": {"prefix": "Prefix here"}}}`   
2. Replace the token entry lines inside main.py to how you want it to be handled (based on your application).
*If you're new, remove the last 2nd & 3rd line and replace the arguments inside bot.run with the string of your bot token.*
3. Optional: Inside on_ready function, the 2nd line channel ID should be replaced to a testing server ID.

If you want to host this bot, please try to refer people to this github page as a credit. If you want to contact me in case you want to help hosting this bot, [you could try contacting me on Discord](https://discord.bio/p/kathelynn).
