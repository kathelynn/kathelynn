#### This bot is an experiment, and is not meant to be ran individually.
You can use anything from my projects as you wish. Please help me fix bugs and optimize code, any feedback is appreciated!

If you still want to run this bot locally, please do the following by order:
1. Create a file named `allysaqt.json`. Inside the file, place the following:   
`{"global":{"settings": {"prefix": "a$"}, "commands":{"ping":{"content":"Pong!"}}}}`   
2. Replace the token entry lines inside main.py to how you want it to be handled (based on your application).
*If you're new, remove the last 2nd line and replace the arguments inside bot.run with the string of your bot token.*
3. Optional: Inside on_ready function, the channel ID should be replaced to your testing channel ID.

If you want to contact me in case you want to help me on hosting this bot, [you could try contacting me on Discord](https://discord.bio/p/kathelynn).
